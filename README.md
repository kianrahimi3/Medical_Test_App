# test_project

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This is a test app created to learn Flutter. The app will take in patient information and create a profile for them. The idea is to make an app that holds a patient's medical information.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
